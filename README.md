Created an ASP.NET MVC CRUD app using Entity Framework Core and SQL Server. I use .NET 8 MVC template in Visual Studio 2022 to create this CRUD app.

This is a Model View Controller pattern which is a very famous architecture pattern in software design and is equally popular when clubbed together with the ASP.NET framework

I use Bootstrap 5 in this ASP.NET MVC website to style our pages.

I install EF Core packages and use the code-first approach to create our SQL Server database.

This will be a great ASP.NET Core MVC app.
